Ideas for a rewrite of this Project 
(New name: leovms Leonberg Virtual Machine Sharing):

Server:
-------------------------------------------------------
STEP1:
- add a project p_leovms: Uploaders for snapshots

- include a /etc/samba/smb.conf.leovms
  -> must be 
     1) included in /etc/samba/smb.conf.shares
     2) service smbd reload

This makes 2 Shares available:
  leovms-data   /home/leovms/data    RO for base image and snapshots 
  leovms-upload /home/leovms/upload  RW writeble for the group/project leovms



STEP2:
- include a /etc/samba/smb.conf.leovms-ldap
  must be configured with ip, ... to run on a different machine


What is simpler tan before
- Data ist always in /home/leovms
- no Configuration file for the server

- Konfiguration for the clients in in
    -  /home/leovms/data/leovms-client.conf
        - where are the caches
        - how large are the caches
    -  /home/leovms/data/leovms-vbox.conf
        - where are the unzipped machines

     
- In /home/leovms/data ar different virtual machines:
     /home/leovms/data/vm-winxp
     /home/leovms/data/vm-win7
     /home/leovms/data/vm-tails
     /home/leovms/data/vm-ubuntu1204
     .......
     These Contain for this vm:
        1) Base Image
        2) Snapshots
        3) Virtualbox Configuration files
        4) Server configuration files (copied on every start for offline use)





Client:

- mounts the shares in /etc/fstab (possibly in leovms-starter???)

- leovms-starter (leovirtstarter)
  - at start:  
    1) which vm (vm-winxp, vm-win7, virtualBox) -> pick one
    2) set $HOME to $HOME/.leovms (keep $HOME saved in memory)
      ONE of the possible vm's is used and displayed like now
    3) Display list of snapshots -> pick one
    4) extract base file (if necessary)
    5) extract snapshot
    6) copy configuration files to the (new) $HOME
    7) Patch the configuration file
       - Patch the shared directory
       - ... what else ?
    8) Start the machine
       - configure with option:
         - RAM size
         - ... what else?


- uploading a VM from virtualbox
  - additional menu sets $HOME to the normal,real $HOME of the user.
    Then a list of virtalbox machines is displayd, which can be uploaeded
    (uuids a uploaded and the fitting snapshot file)



- offline use (vm is chosen already)
  - additional menu shows 
    left                                    right
    - available vm's on the server          - cached snapshots
    - checkboxes for each machine           - free cache size, ...
  - sync machines:
    pick checkboxes, then press sync button
      -> copies snapshots in the cache


 Configuration:
  - see server





Additional configuration in image.conf
  - update RAM/RAM fixed, ...
